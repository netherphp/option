Nether Option
=====================================
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/netherphp/option/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/netherphp/option)

This package provides a global settings management class to globally manage settings
without globals. It will be used by most of the components in the Nether.

Install
-------------------------------------
To use it stand alone, Composer yourself a netherphp/option with a version of 1.*

If you are using any other Nether components you'll most likely already have this.
